# Hello World With Keras and Tensorflow
A Keras plus Tensorflow hello world!

# Installation:

You can use python2 rather than python3 by doing the following commands:
    
    $ python2 -m virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ python2 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

And then you can execute our hello world by doing: 

    $ python main.py
